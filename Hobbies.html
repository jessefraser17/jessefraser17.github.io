    <P> I have skied ever since I was in 5th grade. I had a school ski lesson trip where we were brought the our local mountain and were instructed on the basics of skiing. I had never skied before prior to the encounter so the first experience had not turned out how I initially had envisioned. I was persistent at learning though and quickly saw progression in my skills. Ive skies ever winter since then and have enjoyed every run down the slopes. </P>

<P> Fishing has been a hobby that that I have only just picked up recently. In the past summer I have fished more than ever before. The thrill of hooking a large fish, reeling it in, and then the being able to examine whatever fish you might have caught is just about the best feeling ever. </P>


<P> FISH OOOOOOON! </P>
