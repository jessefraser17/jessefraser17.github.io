    <P> I have skied ever since I was in 5th grade. I had a school ski lesson trip where we were brought the our local mountain and were instrcuted on the basics of skiing. I had never skied before prior to the encounter so the first experience had not turned out how I initially had envisioned. I was persistent at learning though and quickly saw progression in my skills. Ive skies ever winter since then and have enjoyed every run down the slopes. </P>
