<P> Basketball is a sport that I have played since the 4th grade. I always had a passion for playing year after year. I no longer play competitively but I still enjoy the game and enjoy playing either pickup games or casual play. </P>

<P> Ultimate Frisbee has been on my radar of late. Ive actually never played before but I feel like I could really get into the whole thing! I have been debating about joining the club team here, at Umaine, and still am undecided.</P>
